<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm a gamer, brewer, musician and tech lover residing in sunny San Diego. My journey is a long one, but the best ones come with stories. <br>
My blood may bleed Brunt Orange, but I have come to embrace the California life as a surfer and skater. <br>
Hook Em.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Currently, I'm developing a brewery simulator in Unity. With a unique primary gameplay loop of brewing your own beer, <a href="https://github.com/mpieratt/HalfPint">Half Pint</a> will be a fun time. </p>

<p>Havard's CS50 Intro to Game Developement has been instrumental for providing new skills in Lua and C#. Through the course work, I've developed games similar to Super Mario Bros, Zelda, Dreadhall and <a href="https://github.com/mpieratt/CS50Assignments">many more!</a> </p>

<p>With the assistance of Unity's tutorial, made a 2D game called <a href = "https://github.com/mpieratt/Unity2DTutorial" >Ruby Adventure</a></p>

<p>Also been brewing my own beer on the side, check out <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/redbeard/">Red Beard's Brewery</a></p>
